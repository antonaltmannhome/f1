### this file is intended for bigger jobs

### clean up the whole smoothing and mixing process. there seem to be mutiple ways things that should be more universal: process_smoothing, makesmqmixcoef, makemixqrsmdcoef, yearly-smooth, lblupdate.preparedcoefmix. make code nicer so that there are indicators as to WHY something is not valid for smoothing. it will be complicated though, lots of variations
### investigate differences between old and new simulations
### produce that 'clean race' summary graph
### try to understand vcov(lm model) - make some fictitious data with alomst no overlap between tyres for subsets. this might be a lot easier than MCMC for that sort of problem!
### nice graphical version of pit stop delta
### pit stop correction is a horror show, rewrite that
