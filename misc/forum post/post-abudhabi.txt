So, here we have the US Grand Prix ranking:

###

Bottas narrowly beat Hamilton in this race, with Verstappen also finishing within 5 seconds of Bottas. Bottas and Verstappen both ran two stop strategies, Hamilton only did one stop and all things considered Hamilton comes out marginally ahead. It was an unusual race in that all three tyres were widely used:

###

This race was a fairly straightforward one, with cars freely overtaking and you can see in the 'number of laps included' column that the drivers managed to get plenty of clear laps to show their pace. The midfield battle was interesting in that around lap 40, half the drivers decided to try out a one stop while half gambled on stopping again. The net difference to their positions was minor, with only Raikkonen losing out but that was mainly due to a lack of pace compared to the rest of the midfield.

Finally, I've marked Albon as driving a damaged car even though he recovered from last at the start of lap 2 to 5th place. These decisions are always a bit subjective, his pace compared to Verstappen and the rest of the frontrunners was as it usually is, but it looked like a decent whack and he and the team both mentioned floor damage so I've recorded it as a damaged car.

We next look at Brazil:

###

This will be remembered as a crazy race, but it was fairly normal and straightforward for about 50 laps, so most drivers' race pace is judged on the race until then. There are a few surprises to me in the rankings, for example it felt like a comfortable win for Verstappen, in particular because he overtook Hamilton straight away, twice, during the race, on the other hand he was never more than 2 seconds ahead of Hamilton until the safety car appeared, so their pace can only be judge to be similar.

Sainz worked his way up from last on the grid to 3rd place by the end, yet he seemed to do with average pace. I would stand by this, if you look at his pace in clear air compared to drivers on similar strategies. For example, here are his lap times next to Raikkonen's:

Sainz's pace was similar to Raikkonen's in the first stint, and was similar despite having fresher tyres in the second stint.

###

There was a big gap between the Renault drivers on pace, which is unusual, with Ricciardo winning the midfield pace race comfortably, while Hulkenberg was invisible in the race. It's born out by comparing their lap times:

###

Finally, we look at the Abu Dhabi results:

###

Hamilton and Bottas ranked about equal, with the obvious caveat that Hamilton had a comfortable lead throughout the race while Bottas was chasing cars right until the end.

Ricciardo ends the season with a thumping 'Formula 1.5' victory, however he spent almost the entire race stuck in traffic, his rating is calculated purely on a few clear laps following a late stop at the end of the race, so it's not to be taken too seriously. The big surprise to me here was the relatively low rankings of the Mclarens. But dig into the lap times and it's easy to see why, here are Norris's lap times against Kvyat:

In the second stint Norris is substantially slower despite having fresher tyres.

So that wraps up the race reports for this year. I'll produce the final installment for this season over the weekend, with the updated team mate comparisons, the final average pace ranking for the year, plus a few reflections and thoughts about future plans.
