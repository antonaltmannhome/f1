urgency,status,task,
1,DONE,think about model validation,
1,DONE,compile plots library,
1,DONE,reproduce australia 2018 plots in new world,
1,DONE,"make new world copy to new laptop; can't import cleanf1. I think it's because lap is default NULL on desktop, weirdly, but laptop doesn't like it. Let's rewrite racedriverlap on desktop but with not null lap",
1,DONE,make rprofile work for new r on laptop,
2,,merge yearly smooth and smoothing ideas,
2,DONE,sort out isGoodCarPRoblem ambiguity,
2,,dependency graph,
2,,"move simulations to new world - more important than thought, we want it for outlier race detection",
2,DONE,tyre deg plots in new world,
2,,reproduce weight given lap num for position measure (as opposed to estimation of estimate),
2,,model improvement explanation,
2,DONE,new world strips forix data to separate directory,
3,,reproduce adjustment for dominance in new simulation,
3,,get rid of d/dropbox data duplication,
3,,sort raw updats status flag,
3,,get car graphics from fiverr,
3,,"update new model for new races, check everything still works",
3,DONE,that comment about carproblem in laptimelm,
3,DONE,"get on top of car problem, does IsGoodCarProblem need to exist on DB? It seems to be defined in process-carproblem - no, it's done in validity, seems like it needs ot be too",
2,DONE,driver comments in new world,
3,DONE,"make a ModelSetup function, does the gap stuff and the mod30PRedSec, mod30DCoef etc, so tedious having to do it every time",
3,DONE,that stuff it splurges out every time you do gaptrafficpitstop about pitstopdelta,
3,DONE,DrverRacePlot and StintSummary not working for 2019 australia,
3,DONE,Get it working on laptop again,
3,DONE,"why does greatbritain2017 have NA for the medium tyres' validity? EDIT because no isGoodPreValidRace drivers used it. Only fix if a problem, looks fiddly to fix",
ABOVE SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE SEASON STARTS,,,
4,DONE,what is going on with interrupt in old world,
4,,distinguish between SC and VSC,
4,,make DriverRace export work,
4,,downweight more variable races,
4,,"include more comments on driverraceplot for eg unusual strategy, carproblem",
4,,review joblist.txt,
4,,tyre prior,
4,,"get rid of intercept term in overtkaing circtui coefs, srves no purpose",
4,DONE,could we have a separate InitialisePreRaceCoef for lm fitting and simulation? It doesn't need to be be particularly accurate for lm fitting but using pre-race smooths is hellishly complicated,
4,DONE,improve pit stop delta process,but need to run live to be completely sure it works
4,DONE,try out rbox within atom,
4,,"removing of intermediate columns is a nightmare, maybe there should be a separate function that reads intermediate columns off a spreadsheet and cleans accordingly",
5,,"improve MakeMOdelToUseName so that it can return e.g mod30DCoef, it doesn't at the moment",
5,DONE,move traffic adjustments to new world,
5,,change rate of tyres ,
5,,merge improvement of model explanation with driverrace,
5,,relative tyre wear,
5,,move general functions to library,
6,,"MakePrettyRaceDF should take a vector of race names, not the entire DF",
6,,get rid of websiteplot dir in every data dir?,
7,DONE,transfer stint interruption and guessed pit stops to new world,
7,,is there really a qulaifying adjline? Investigate,
7,,have a messy race library. Both stint-interrupt and predicting position could use it,
8,,"add a useCurrentRace option to smoothingm you can't get smooth after final race of a season at the moment; EDIT this is really hard I think, just not an easy way to hack the current code to do this. Or is there? Maybe could have fwbw mode of 'do final race', then i think you might be able to just add a few lines to the bit where is defines isFitValid. but you will still have the problem of not having normQualDCoef until after the race",
8,DONE,"proper csv to do team name maps, need toleman, BAR etc, replace team-colour csv name with it not doeteamcolour thing, fine as is I think",
8,DONE,"that bit where it says Using previously saved values for smoothing, then nothing",
8,,"when checking if race summary in get-forix-extra is ok, display race name",
8,,"when checking if red flags are accurate, display race name",
8,,say what the horizontal line is in the wet race checker,
8,,remove safety car laps in carproblem checking diagnostic plot,
8,,"the carproblem graphs are still pretty shit, just adding a few labels explaining what is suspicious wouldn't be hard",
8,,"have a verbost option for LoadAllData, silence it when it's just being loaded at the start of a Process… function",
8,,have some sort of system where very bad car problem drivers don't influence the tyre coefs but very bad ones do,
